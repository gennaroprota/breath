To build the documentation with Doxygen:

 - download the Doxygen tool from <http://www.doxygen.org/>

 - install it (or unpack it to a folder of your choice if you
   downloaded the zip/tar.gz file)

 - cd to $BREATH_ROOT/doc/source

 - issue the command <doxygen directory>/doxygen doxygen.cfg

The documentation will appear in $BREATH_ROOT/doc/.
