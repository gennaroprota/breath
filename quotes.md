This is a collection of quotes that I agree with and summarize my view on
software development, and on the way to produce reliable software that is easy
to understand an maintain, on time and in budget, which is my main professional
concern. When possible, I added a reference to the full source, so that you can
see the quote in context (in every reference, I've tried to respect the
capitalization and the punctuation chosen by the author&mdash;this means that
there are inconsistencies, even for the same author).

 - Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. &mdash;[Often attributed to
   Leonardo Da Vinci. The source is actually disputed.]

 - There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it
   so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to
   make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first
   method is far more difficult. It demands the same skill, devotion, insight,
   and even inspiration as the discovery of the simple physical laws which
   underlie the complex phenomena of nature. &mdash;C. A. R. Hoare, *The
   Emperor's Old Clothes*, 1980 Turing Award Lecture; *Communications of the
   ACM* **24** (2), (February 1981)

 - The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his
   own skull; therefore he approaches the programming task in full humility, and
   among other things he avoids clever tricks like the plague. &mdash;E. W.
   Dijkstra (1972) *The Humble Programmer.* (EWD340)

 - In the latter respect software seems to be different from many other
   products, where as a rule a higher quality implies a higher price. Those who
   want really reliable software will discover that they must find means of
   avoiding the majority of bugs to start with, and as a result the programming
   process will become cheaper. If you want more effective programmers, you will
   discover that they should not waste their time debugging, they should not
   introduce the bugs to start with. &mdash;*ibidem*

 - Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability. &mdash;E. W. Dijkstra (1975) *How
   do we tell truths that might hurt?* (EWD498; this sentence only appears in
   some of the transcriptions available on the web)

 - Simplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and
   education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse: complexity sells
   better. &mdash;E. W. Dijkstra (1984) *On the nature of computing science.*
   (EWD896)

 - How do we convince people that in programming simplicity and clarity --in
   short: what mathematicians call "elegance"-- are not a dispensable luxury,
   but a crucial matter that decides between success and failure? &mdash;E. W.
   Dijkstra (year?) *"Why is software so expensive?" An explanation to the
   hardware designer.* (EWD648)

 - You know that testing will not find all the problems and that if the
   production process produced a lemon, that car will probably always be a
   lemon, regardless of the amount of final test and inspection. Programs are no
   different. &mdash;W. S. Humphrey (1997) *Introduction to the Personal
   Software Process*

 - An attitude of "I'm too busy, we can fix it later," is unlikely to produce a
   superior product. To produce quality software, every software development
   step must be of high quality. While such rigorous quality practices may seem
   expensive, they will actually save time. &mdash;*ibidem*

 - The real problem is that programmers have spent far too much time worrying
   about efficiency in the wrong places and at the wrong times; premature
   optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming.
   &mdash;D. E. Knuth, *Computer Programming as an Art*, 1974 Turing Award
   Lecture, Communications of the ACM **17** (12), (December 1974)
