#       The recommended name extension for YAML files is '.yaml', but
#       Travis CI requires '.yml', instead; so we supported both. Now
#       that we switched to GitHub Actions, I wonder: does GitHub allow
#       '.yaml' everywhere?
#
#       As to indent_size, YAML looks irregular with 4-space indentation
#       when you use "- "; consider e.g. this snippet:
#
#         include:
#             - os: linux
#               dist: xenial
#
#               addons:
#                 apt:
#                     sources:
#                         - ubuntu-toolchain-r-test
#                     packages:
#                         - g++-6
#
#       Here, "- os: linux" is indented by 4 spaces, but the line
#       immediately after it is indented by 2, to align with
#       "os: linux". Similarly, "apt:", which was aligned by pressing
#       the tab key, is only 2 spaces to the right of "addons:". So, I
#       think, either one never uses the tab key and always adds 4
#       spaces "manually", or use the 2-space indentation that everyone
#       is using. I chose the latter.
