#       Maintenance note:
#       -----------------
#
#       Be sure that modifications to these options don't put the
#       various compiler-specific makefiles out of sync (e.g. by
#       requiring C++14 with one compiler and C++17 with another).
#
#
#       As usual, the options are listed in two groups. The group
#       appearing first relates mainly to standards conformance. The
#       other group contains other options in alphabetical order.
#
#       Special notes for some of the options:
#       ======================================
#
#       (See gcc.mk for further notes on some options.)
#
#       -Wno-weak-vtables:
#
#           The -Wweak-vtables warning tries to point out possible
#           object files bloat, but that's probably moot either because
#           it isn't really going to make a difference on performances,
#           and because the linker will likely collapse the duplicated
#           vtables anyway.
#
#           So this warning can be safely suppressed. Note, too, that it
#           would be difficult to silence it by modifying the code, as
#           in the case (as of Febrary 27, 2019) for the class
#           command_line_error, in command_line.hpp.
#
#       -Wno-zero-as-null-pointer-constant
#
#           Silences warnings on things like:
#
#             if ( GetModuleHandle( L"kernel32" ) == NULL )
#                 ...
#
#           (we don't want to use nullptr, there). GCC seems to be
#           smarter and doesn't give such warnings when the option is
#           enabled.
