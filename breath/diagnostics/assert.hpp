//      BREATH_ASSERT():
//      ================
//
//!     \hideinitializer
//!
//!     %BREATH_ASSERT() is the simplest runtime assertion facility in
//!     the Breath collection. Differently from the standard \c
//!     assert() it is always defined and has always the same
//!     expansion (regardless of \c NDEBUG).
//!
//!     The code <code>BREATH_ASSERT( expr )</code> expands to an
//!     expression. When that expression is evaluated: first, if \c expr
//!     is not implicitly convertible to \c bool the program is
//!     ill-formed; otherwise, an assertion is triggered if the result
//!     that conversion is \c false. If the result is \c true, the
//!     evaluation has no effects besides the conversion to \c bool
//!     itself.
//!
//!     In this context, "triggering an assertion" means writing
//!     information related to the specific macro invocation (e.g.
//!     line number and source file name) to \c std::cerr, then
//!     calling \c std::abort().
//!
//!     Rationale
//!     ---------
//!
//!     It has become "common practice" to define the macro \c NDEBUG
//!     when compiling the "release" version of code. Many IDEs do so
//!     silently. In fact, \c NDEBUG (or a logical complement of it,
//!     such as \c _DEBUG) has become the macro which is usually
//!     checked for by your library code to know which version of it
//!     (release/debug) you want to link with.
//!     We believe, though, that assertions must be left on in the
//!     release version of the product. So we wanted an assert macro
//!     decoupled from \c NDEBUG. (Thinking of it, there has been a
//!     fatal misunderstanding: the C committee thought of a macro to
//!     enable/disable assertions, but alas named it "NDEBUG", which
//!     suggests "no debug". And that's the meaning everyone seems to
//!     have assigned to it. Had they called it e.g. "NASSERT" all
//!     this wouldn't probably have happened.)
